**DATE:20/09/2025**  
**SLOT:5M1-1**


## AIM: To simulate the performance of R-2R  circuits using LT- SPICE                

---

## PROCEDURE:
1.Double click on LT- SPICE  icon
2.New schematic window open
3.Pick and paste the required component from the library and draw the circuit diagram .
4.Complete the connection.
5.Save the file by giving file name.
6.Click on the run option ->click advanced open ->select Ac analysis->enter the amplitude-> time delay stop time value.
7.Click on the run option ->simulationwindow opens->place the probe ->output graph is obtained
